# It doesn't work yet

# Neural-Detail

The plan is for a script that will sequentually increase Neural-Style's output size so that the final output will be different than the normal output at the final output size.

# Requirement

You should have [Neural-Style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/) first!

# Usage
Copy this script to neural-style directory, then run:

`./Neural-Detail.sh $input_file $style_image`

If you face a permission error, try using chmod to fix the issue: 

`chmod u+x ./Neural-Detail.sh`
